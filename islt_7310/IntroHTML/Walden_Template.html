	One reason I made this website is to showcase to you my work and my <em>passions</em> for various media related projects.</br> Here you will see my many video projects I have created over the years along with other miscellaneous projects as well. Another objective of this website is to look at the various ways media is being made and how it can be expressed in many different platforms. For instance, there is expressing art through video, graphic design, or even through audio. Finding your voice is one key element to unlocking your potential as a <b>content creator.</b> With video editing, many content creators use Adobe Premiere which is the standard video editing program throughout the world. However, I will go into more details later about the program. As for graphic design, the gold standard is Photoshop and Illustrator which are used for raster and vector images respectively. Once again, I will go into more details later.
<h3>
		Video Editing
</h3>
	As a teenager, I also enjoyed <em>editing videos</em> and I knew that this was something that I wanted to do, especially when I started learning premiere at the age of 20. Since then, I have edited many videos over the years and have grown my experience level. I hope you get to see some of my work when you visit my website. Thank you for taking the time to view my work and I hope you enjoy what you see.
