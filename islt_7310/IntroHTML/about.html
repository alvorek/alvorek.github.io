	My name is Cody James Walden and I was born on <em>December 15th</em> of 1994. I have lived in <b>Columbia Missouri</b> my whole life and I graduated high school in May of 2013 from Rockbridge High School. Growing up, I always had a love for computers and technology and during my kid years, I played many video and computer games. This inspired me to get a job in the tech field, specifically in the creative side of tech. <br>
