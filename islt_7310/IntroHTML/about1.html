	About Me
</h2>
<p>
	My name is Cody James Walden and I was born on <em>December 15th</em> of 1994. I have lived in <b>Columbia Missouri</b> my whole life and I graduated high school in May of 2013 from Rockbridge High School. Growing up, I always had a love for computers and technology and during my kid years, I played many video and computer games. This inspired me to get a job in the tech field, specifically in the creative side of tech. <br>
<h3>
		Video Editing
</h3>
	As a teenager, I also enjoyed <em>editing videos</em> and I knew that this was something that I wanted to do, especially when I started learning premiere at the age of 20. Since then, I have edited many videos over the years and have grown my experience level. I hope you get to see some of my work when you visit my website. Thank you for taking the time to view my work and I hope you enjoy what you see.

	I am currently going to school for IT at the University of Missouri. In the past, I took classes at Encircle Technologies where I learned video editing along with taking some HTML classes in the past but it's been since 2017 since I have done HTML so this is a refresher for me
