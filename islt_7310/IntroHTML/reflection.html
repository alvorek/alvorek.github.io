<h3>A reflection...</h3>
<p> 
As a reflection of my career, I have learned a lot over the years. For one thing, my video editing
experience has improved in the ten year span that I have worked on video editing projects. Growing up, I
used a very simple program called Windows Live Movie Maker on my old 2012 laptop that I had.
Eventually in 2016, I switched to using Adobe Premiere and learned how to edit videos that way.</br></br>

For me, I am very proficient in the use of Adobe Premiere. One thing I need to work on is knowing what
content to create though because thinking of ideas can be the difficult part. There are many people who
make a career out of Youtube but they generally need a good idea that people would want to watch.
Obviously, some videos to make are easier than others. I can imagine that anybody who makes video
essays for a living has a lot of work cut out for them.</br></br>

One of my current goals is to figure out what I want to do with my life after I graduate from college. I really
enjoy video editing but I am not sure if this is what I am going to wind up doing. Is video editing a viable
profession? Will I need to move somewhere else? These are questions I have to ask myself if I want to
get into professional video editing.</br></br>

If I were to move to a different city, I would like to move somewhere warmer. I was thinking about living in
either California, Texas, or Florida to take advantage of the warmer weather and the bigger city life. One
advantage of living in a bigger city is that there is more diversity and also more opportunities to meet
people. If you live in a bigger city, chances are you can meet people with similar interests to yourself. If
you live in a small town however, if you are a lot different from everyone there, then it can be difficult to
find your place.</br></br>
